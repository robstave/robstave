# About Me

- Senior Software Engineer/Team Lead
- Fiddler - Texas Country Music
- Sound Tinkerer (Arduino, Modular Synths, ATTINY85)
- Golang/Javascript/Typescript/Java and whatever Arduino is...C++???
- If AI gives me a solution in Python...well, sure, I can roll with that too.

I’d like to dive deeper into Haskell and Rust. Honestly, though, for what I do, the language isn’t as important as the libraries and support.

# Featured Projects

## Arduino Component Sketches

[ACS](https://github.com/robstave/ArduinoComponentSketches)

A collection of sketches for ATTiny to replace logic blocks in Lunetta-like circuits or whatever else comes to mind. They can be standalone diversions or the core for a modular synth component. Keep in mind, it’s an 8-bit microcontroller.

I really like making things blink and go beep. There are *a lot* of sketches that do just that. Mostly for ATTINY85, but a few other chips are supported. It’s Arduino code, so most sketches can be refactored pretty easily.

## Meowmorize

[Meowmorize](https://github.com/robstave/meowmorize)

A Golang/React-based flashcard app.  
- Import format compatible with ChatGPT, so you can just ask it to create cards in markdown and import them.  
- Progress stats.  
- Cards are written in markdown, with code formatting supported.  

It’s Dockerized—so why not give it a spin?

## ATTINY85 Latex Builder

[Latex Builder](https://github.com/robstave/attiny85-latex)

Create cool Latex ATTINY85 pinouts from JSON files. The idea was to automate the images I use in the Arduino repo above. The tool works, but remaking all the images is still a chore I haven’t gotten around to yet.

# Other Smaller Learning Projects

These are more just exercises and fun experiments.

## D3 Mitre Attack Widget

[D3 Mitre Exercise](https://github.com/robstave/d3-mitre-ai-experiment)

An experiment to see how little code I actually needed to write using ChatGPT. Turns out...practically none! I had it build a D3 widget interactively without manually changing any code—just a conversation (and a little copy/paste into JSFiddle).
