# About Me

- Software Developer/Team Lead
- Fiddler ( Texas Country Music )
- Sound Tinkerer ( Arduino, Modular Synths, ATTINY85 )
- Golang/JS/TS/Java and whatever Arduino is...C++ ???
- If AI gives a solution in Python...well...sure.  Python

Would like to get more Haskell/Rust under my belt.  Honestly, for what I do, the language is not as important as the libraries/support.

# Featured Projects

## Arduino Component Sketches

[ACS](https://github.com/robstave/ArduinoComponentSketches)

Collection of sketches for ATTiny to replace logic blocks in lunetta like circuits or whatever. They can be stand alone diversions or the core for a modular synth component.  Keep in mind, its an 8 bit microcontroller though.

I really like to make things blink and go beep.  A LOT of sketches that do that.  Mostly for ATTINY85 but a few other chips are supported.  Its arduino code, so most sketches can be refactored pretty easily.

[D3 Mitre exercise](https://github.com/robstave/d3-mitre-ai-experiment)

An attempt to see just how little code I could write with chatGPT.  I had it build a D3 widget interatively without changing any code.  Just a conversation ( and a little copy/paste into JS fiddle )
